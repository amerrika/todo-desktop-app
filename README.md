# Frontend Mentor - Full-stack Todo App (Desktop only)

This is my first full-stack project based on the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). I added extra features of my own and still working on it.

## The challenge
Your users should be able to:
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## Tools
- Frontend with Vue.js 3 Options API, SCSS, Vue Router, Axios
- Backend with Express, CORS, Mongoose, MongoDB,
- Concurrently to run the project with one command
- Basic CSS media print to style task list for printing

## Acknowledgments
- I came across this very useful [tutorial](https://www.bezkoder.com/vue-node-express-mongodb-mevn-crud/) on building a project with MEVN stack and I learned a lot from it.
